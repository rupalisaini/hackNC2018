# "Who Wants to Marry the Dictator?"
is a text-based game that uses a Discord channel as its interface. Players can log into a channel, control the game by typing commands, and win by getting other players eliminated. Once eliminated, a player may observe the rest of the game but cannot participate. The winner gets nothing. 

This game was made for HackNC 2018 as a collaboration between @Nivrad00 and @rupalisaini.
