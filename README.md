"Who Wants to Marry the Dictator?" is a text-based game that uses a Discord channel as its interface. Players can log into a channel, control the game by typing commands, and win by getting other players eliminated. Once eliminated, a player may observe the rest of the game but cannot participate. The winner gets nothing.
