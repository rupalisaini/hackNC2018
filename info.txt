Who Wants to Marry the Dictator?

Dear loyal subject,

Your Supreme Dictator is looking for love! You have been chosen to take part in the new and exciting game show, "Who Wants to Marry the Dictator?" in which one lucky subject will get to marry our Supreme Dictator.* Be there, or we'll kill you! Just kidding!**

*All other contestants will be executed.
**Not actually kidding.

- one player is the dictator, the others are contestants
- the goal of the contestants is to be the last contestant standing and get to marry the dictator
- the contestants are each given a short bio at the start of the game, which they can use to woo the dictator
- gameplay proceeds in rounds, during which contestants can make their case (e.g. "I am in love with your flabby bod.") 
- at the end of each round, the dictator eliminates one contestant and censors one word of their choice. from then on, any contestant who says that word is immediately executed by surveillance drones.

- also rupali sucks
